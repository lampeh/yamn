Yet Another Mix Net - A Mixmaster derivative

YAMN tries to look like Mixmaster in order to maintain compatibility with the
various GUI's and peripheral applications that serve to make it a complete
solution.  Under the covers there will be some significant differences:-

* Revised crypto functions.  Instead of Mixmaster's Triple-DES, RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5
and MD5, YAMN will use AES, NaCl Box and Blake2.

* Deterministic header padding to protect against tagging attacks

Installation from source:
go build

Post-install configuration:-
Create a dir for yamn.  (mkdir yamn)
